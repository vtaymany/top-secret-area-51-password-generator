# top-secret-area-51-password-generator

## Main project goal

- This project randomly generates a password that meets certain criteria outlined by the user. This program is design to provide greater security for companies whose employees have access to sensitive data.

## Updates

### JS

- This update adds functionality to the application
  - What makes this application unique is the way it selects a random value for the password
    - Every value chosen to be in the password has an equal probability of being either a lowercase character, an uppercase character, a number, or a special character - no matter how many possible values there are for each character type.

## Installation

- No installation is required. The webpage may be viewed [here](https://vtaymany.github.io/top-secret-area-51-password-generator/)

## Roadmap

- It is advised to collect user inputs from HTML forms rather than alert prompts.
  - Many form elements such as checkboxes have some degree of validation and logic built in which would help clean up the code.
